					<p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">Silverline Tutoring is an educational 501(c)(3) nonprofit
						connecting tutors and students within our organization of over 5000 dedicated members. Founded by
						college and high school students, this company recognizes the difficulty of learning—we’ve all
						been there.</p>

					<p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">From the depths of math to complex texts in English,
						every student has struggled at one point or another. We want to bridge this divide in education
						by providing free tutoring to any student. But how do we accomplish this difficult task?</p>

					<p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">Silverline creates a free and flexible tutoring service
						by finding the experts in our community and assigning them to students in need. For instance, if
						someone has 2+ years of experience in chemistry, they would apply to become a tutor and earn
						community service hours in exchange for their work. This framework allows us to serve as many
						students as possible at the cost of nothing while still maintaining quality. </p>

					<p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">At Silverline, we want to solve the education divide, one
						student at a time, by making learning enjoyable and stress-free for all. Therefore, we never
						hold students accountable to a strict schedule and always work based on the student needs,
						allowing them to benefit the most. Our tutors are vetted in advance to ensure that they are
						student-friendly and adaptable. Monthly trivia contests and other games are also held to promote
						a fun learning environment. We want to set our students up for success while building a strong
						community that facilitates opportunities for everyone involved. Because of this foundation, our
						community now serves up to 5000 members.</p>

					<p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">Silverline is primarily for students in high school.
						However, our reach extends beyond simply highschoolers. We also offer services to elementary and
						middle schoolers and college-level students, depending on the course. Our diverse group of
						tutors allows us to serve a greater population of people. </p>

					<p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">Additionally, aside from students, adults and any other
						age group are also welcome if they are looking for a refresher in a past course or simply
						looking to learn something new.</p>

					<p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">In terms of tutors, Silverline accepts anyone from
						sophomore year of highschool and above. In the past, we have had school teachers helping in our
						system, meaning that even adults are more than welcome to join our community. Therefore,
						regardless of age or education, Silverline is an open outlet for all groups whether it be in the
						form of being a student or a teacher.</p>

					<p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">I like how the tutors are very friendly and explain the topics 
					in a very understanding way. They are quick to respond whenever I have a question. This organization 
					is great if you want to improve in any subject or if you want to work on a hobby such as chess.</p>

					<p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300"> was struggling in math so I requested a tutor. I got so much 
					help from my tutor and it was free to top it all off. This organization is great for anyone who is 
					struggling in any subject and wants help from qualified tutors. The self-serving system also works as 
					although I was previously a student, I'm now the head tutor.</p>

					<p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">Silverline Tutoring is a great organization given the fact 
					that it is free, has several tutors almost always active, and has a very active and friendly community. 
					I really enjoy being tutored for free and it helps the tutors because they gain community service hours just 
					for tutoring you. I would recommend that you join the organization </p>
					
					<p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="500">I was looking for help on computer science and requested a tutor 
					at Silverline Tutoring. Within a couple of hours I was paired with a tutor and we met the next day over zoom. 
					My tutor was able to break down the topic and made it really easy for me to understand. He helped me 
					pass the class with an A+</p>

					<p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">I was looking for quick help from the helpers in the organization, 
					and I asked for help on a physics question I had and I got a response and help within minutes.</p>
					
					<p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="700">Silverline Tutoring is simply the best, I got so much help on my 
					homework and the helpers quickly answered all the questions I had </p>
